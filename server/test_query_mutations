      scouting_report: "The son of four-time All-Star Dante Bichette, Bo has pure hitting ability that earned him an above-slot signing bonus of $1,100,000 as Toronto's second-round pick in 2016. He made an immediate impact after signing, hitting .427/.451/.732 in his pro debut, and then paced the Minors with a .362 average the following year in his first full season. Spending all of 2018 as a 20-year-old in Double-A, Bichette led the Eastern League in hits (154), doubles (43), extra-base hits (61), runs scored (95) and total bases (244) as the circuit's second-youngest regular. Along the way, he represented the U.S. in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game for a second straight year."

The Blue Jays ended up selecting the JC of Central Florida product with the second of their two first-round picks the following month, signed him for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900 and then watched him light up radar guns during a dominant pro debut. Pearson's first full season lasted just 1 2/3 innings as he suffered a fractured right forearm after being struck by a line drive in early May, but he returned to the mound and impressed in the Arizona Fall League, finishing with a series of strong outings after a rusty start.",
